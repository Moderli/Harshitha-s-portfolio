    description: "During my internship at Masters’ Union, I worked on promoting various competitions and programs. The biggest lesson I learned? Marketing is all about ROI—no matter how creative your work is, if it doesn’t bring results, it doesn’t matter. It was an amazing experience working on real projects, leading a team, and pushing myself. I even topped the leaderboards, which made it all the more rewarding.",

This love for creativity led me to start my own craft business through a simple Instagram page and local groups. I successfully completed 50+ customized orders across my area and the state of Punjab. It was my first real taste of entrepreneurship.",

    description: "It all started when I had this idea and teamed up with three other teens I met online—we were just four online friends trying to build something meaningful. That’s how Hustle Shala was born. We organized free career counselling workshops, ran skill-based competitions, and even created challenges where students had to team up and make real money by completing specific tasks within a set time. It was messy, exciting, and insanely hectic—late nights, 1000s of creatives, reels, PDFs, and back-to-back events, all managed by us. No mentors, no funding—just pure hustle. It was my first real experience leading a team and running actual operations. Even though we shut it down with minimal profit, the lessons it gave me in execution, teamwork, and leadership were priceless.",
